The preliminary version is based on isa.py and main.py.
Machine.py is an "improved" version of the isa.py that I need to try another concept.
The program to run is main.py and the assembly test program is prg.asm.
Opening the main.py it is possible to switch on and off the debug mode or to activate the cProfiler.
